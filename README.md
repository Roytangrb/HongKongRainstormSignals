## Description
From our Hong Kong Observatory's Website, I captured the rainstorm warning signals data from 1998 March to present, and created this visual. 

In Hong Kong, rainstorms are categorised as three levels: amber, red and black, black is the most severe. Each issued warning signal is plotted as a scatter plot, with its color representing the signal level, x-axis value stating the date, and the y-axis value on the left indicating the duration of warning signals. By this scatter plot, we can see in some periods of years there were more rainstorms, and we can locate the rainstorm warning which lasted for longest or shortest. For example, the longest duration of an amber rainstorm warning was about 17.5 hours.

A line is also plotted to show the total trend of number of signals issued through the years. We can also find the years where there were most rainstorms and least rainstorms.
